# Implementation Plans

Maintained by the improve skill. First audit 2026-06-14 (commit `557eaf4f`);
second audit + reconcile 2026-07-07 (commit `07c2d2fe`). Execute in the order
below unless dependencies say otherwise. Each executor: read the plan fully
before starting, honor its STOP conditions, and update your row when done.

## Execution order & status

Status values: TODO | IN PROGRESS | DONE | BLOCKED (with one-line reason) | REJECTED (with one-line rationale)

Non-interactive default (2026-07-07 run): the maintainer was not available to
select findings, so plans were written for the top 5 by leverage (007–011).
Direction findings (below) were deliberately left unplanned pending a product
decision.

## Recommended sequencing (2026-07-07)

1. **007 first** — highest-leverage open item (compliance gap, all pieces
   already exist in-repo) and a prerequisite for 008's runtime verification.
2. **009, 010, 011** — small, independent, each self-verifying; any order.
3. **008 after 007** — the c15t 2.x upgrade needs the mounted banner to
   smoke-test against.
4. **004 and 006 remain valid** from the first audit — small, independent,
   good warm-ups; each has its own drift check.

## Dependency notes

- 008 → 007: the consent UI must be mounted before the c15t major upgrade is
  verifiable at runtime.
- 011 regenerates `src/registry/__index__.tsx` (all 103 `|| item.name`
  fallback lines change) — that generated diff is expected.
- 004 regenerates `src/registry/transformed/**` and `public/r/**` via
  `pnpm registry:build` — expected in its diff.

## Findings considered and rejected (so they are not re-audited)

From the 2026-06-14 audit:

- **ClipboardItem given `Promise<string>`** (doc-page-actions.tsx): NOT a bug —
  valid per the Clipboard API spec and TS DOM types.
- **"GitHub contributions promise not awaited"** (github-contributions/index.tsx):
  NOT a bug — intended React 19 `use()` streaming pattern.
- **Committed secret in `.env.local`**: NOT exposed — gitignored and untracked.
- **`src/registry/transformed/` duplication**: NOT debt — autogenerated mirror.
- **`console.log` in `events.ts`**: NOT a prod issue — stripped by
  `removeConsole` in `next.config.ts` (excludes only `error`). Re-reported and
  re-rejected 2026-07-07.
- **De-dupe the two GitHub-contributions fetchers**: rejected — different
  shapes/cache keys; deliberately separate.

Added by the 2026-07-07 audit:

- **p5 statically bundled via the 404 page** (daikanoid): NOT a bug —
  `src/components/daikanoid/index.tsx` already wraps the component in
  `next/dynamic` with `ssr: false`, so p5 is code-split. Residual nit: on
  mobile 404s the game section is only CSS-hidden (`max-lg:hidden`), so the
  chunk still lazy-loads on mount — conditional rendering would save it;
  noted as low-value, not planned.
- **Five icon libraries as duplicate deps**: NOT waste — three are consumed
  only by the dynamically-imported registry icon-browser; lucide is the app
  default. Deliberate feature.
- **Homepage client/server boundaries**: sound — data widgets fetch
  server-side with `unstable_cache`; client components are genuinely
  interactive.
- **Raw `<img>` in `embed.tsx`**: likely deliberate (unknown embed
  dimensions don't fit `next/image` without `fill` gymnastics). Not planned.
- **Registry `Index` metadata in the client bundle** (old plan 003):
  downgraded and rejected — see status table.
- **`"use server"` on `blocks.ts` as a data-exposure risk**: the payload is
  public registry metadata, so no current leak; the directive removal is
  bundled into plan 009 as pattern hygiene rather than a security fix.

## Lower-value findings noted but not planned (2026-07-07)

- `DEVELOPMENT.md` "Before pushing" omits `pnpm test:run` (CI runs it) and
  says "every push and PR" when CI triggers are PRs→main and pushes→staging.
  One-line doc fix; fold into any nearby PR.
- `@visx/*` packages are exact-pinned to `4.0.1-alpha.0`, a prerelease with
  no stable successor (`latest` is 4.0.0). Works today; revisit if charts
  are touched — moving to stable `^4.0.0` needs manual visual verification
  of the Insights charts, which doesn't suit a cheap executor.
- Site-vs-registry component copies have drifted (`github-stars`,
  `toc-minimap`, `copy-button`, `code-block-command`: site versions are on
  Base UI with analytics/UTM; registry versions are on Radix with extra
  props). Needs per-component product decisions about the intended source of
  truth — flagged for the maintainer, not planned.
- The Radix→Base UI migration is roughly half done (20 Base UI vs 34 Radix
  components, both tooltip providers nested in `providers.tsx`). Tracked by
  the maintainer's own `.migration/` docs; an advisor plan would add nothing.
- MDX plugin layer (`rehype-npm-command`, `rehype-component`,
  `remark-component`, …) has zero tests — natural follow-up after plan 011
  establishes the characterization pattern (noted in 011's maintenance
  notes).
- The maintained doc-writing skill lives at
  `.agents/skills/ncdai-writing-component-docs/` and is not auto-discovered
  by Claude Code (`.claude/` has no skills dir). One-line fix if wanted:
  symlink or reference from `AGENTS.md`. (It does appear available in the
  current session's skill list, so this may already be wired user-side.)

## Direction findings (2026-07-07) — options for the maintainer, no plans written

Evidence-grounded product options, in rough leverage order. Say the word and
any of these becomes a design/spike plan.

1. **Make hooks a browsable surface** — `registry:hook` items (`use-sound`,
   `use-controllable-state`) are installable via CLI but invisible on the
   site: nav has no Hooks entry (`src/config/site.ts`), `/components` builds
   only from `getComponentDocs()`, and neither hook has a doc page. The doc
   pipeline already derives categories from content folders, so a
   `content/hooks/` folder + route mirroring `/components` is cheap (M).
2. **Give blocks doc pages** — 11 blocks have live previews but zero MDX/SEO
   pages (`src/features/doc/content/` has only `blog/` and `components/`).
   Same pipeline generalization; each block page is an indexable landing
   surface (M).
3. **Document the styles registry** — 9 `registry:style` items; 7
   theme-toggle variants are buried in one doc, `thin-scrollbar` has no doc
   at all (M).
4. **Surface "updated" badges / per-component changelog** — frontmatter
   already carries `createdAt`/`updatedAt`, unused for trust signals;
   registry consumers currently can't tell when a component changed (M,
   coarse).
5. **Trending components from existing analytics** — `copy_npm_command` etc.
   already flow to PostHog/OpenPanel but are write-only; a read path could
   rank components on `/components` (L, needs a data round-trip that doesn't
   exist yet).

Open product questions carried forward:

- **Dual analytics** (PostHog + OpenPanel both fire on every `trackEvent`) —
  still unconsolidated as of 2026-07-07; which is the source of truth?
  (Also interacts with consent scope in plan 007.)
- ~~(98cn) Windows-98 UI kit~~ — resolved: removed from the tree.

## Execution log

### 2026-06-14 (see git history of this file for full detail)

001 and 002 executed and verified DONE on `staging`. Worktree-isolation
caveat from that run (worktrees created from `origin/main` instead of
`staging` HEAD): resolve before dispatching executors again if `main` and
`staging` have diverged.

### 2026-07-07 reconcile

- 001/002 re-verified DONE against the live tree (CI workflow present with
  test step; 4 test files green).
- 003 rejected (React.lazy generation landed independently).
- 004/006 re-verified still open and still accurate.
- 005 superseded by 008.
- New audit (4 parallel subagents + advisor vetting) produced plans 007–011.
